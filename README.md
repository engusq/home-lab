# Homelab

## Introduction
This repository is the central hub for the documentation of my homelab.

At first attracted by this as a hobby experiment and a way of better protecting my privacy, now it has turned into a place to learn new technologies and develop my sysadmin and DevOps skills. Here I can tinker with Docker, VMs, Kubernetes, and the like freely, always trying to increase the security and the ease of maintenance of the whole infrastructure.
## Architecture
Currently, I use a bare metal installation of [Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS](https://ubuntu.com/server) to host my containers. I first choose this set up because it had great community support, but I will be moving everything over to various VMs in [Proxmox](https://proxmox.com/en/) very soon. This new environment will give me more flexibility and a greater ability to separate tests from stable deployments.
## Hardware
At the moment, my homelab equipment consists only of a single Samsung laptop. It's enough for now, but I'm looking to expand when I can.
- Samsung Galaxy Book 3, i7-1355U/16GB RAM/512GB SSD
